<h1 class="center">Thank you and good night</h1>

<p>
Mishira was a personal audiovisual production tool used for editing and broadcasting live video over the internet that was specifically designed for people who play video games. Unfortunately it is no longer in development. We recommend using either OBS or XSplit instead for live streaming gaming content depending on your requirements.

<p>The source code for Mishira can still be found on <a href="https://www.github.com/mishira">GitHub</a> if that is of interest to you.</p>
