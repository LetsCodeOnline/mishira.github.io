	<h3>Low network impact</h3>
	<p>If you want to live stream online multiplayer video games then you'll love Mishira's network subsystem.

	<h3>Interact with your viewers</h3>
	<p>If you're broadcasting video games make it even more entertaining for your viewers by adding a webcam and microphone so they can see who's actually behind the controls. By being able to see your facial expressions as you experience the game your viewers will feel more immersed in the game world itself as they'll feel like they are right there next to you.</p>
