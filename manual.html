<h1 class="center">Mishira user manual</h1>

<p>
The official Mishira user manual is currently under construction. We'll try and write it as soon as we can. :(

Want to use a capture card that isn't detected as a web cam? Try using <a href="http://www.amarectv.com/english/amarectv_e.htm">AmaRecTV</a> to capture the device and then use a normal Window capture layer in Mishira.

If you would like to help us write it then feel free to <a href="/contribute.html">contribute</a>!
