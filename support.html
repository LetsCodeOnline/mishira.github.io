<h1 class="center">Need assistance? We'll try our best to help</h1>

<p>
Mishira is a completely free and open source project maintained entirely by volunteers. We will do our best to help you out getting Mishira to work the way you want it to but please keep in mind that our resources are extremely limited and we are not currently available 24/7.

	<h3>User manual</h3>
	<p>Mishira's official user manual can be found <a href="/manual.html">here</a> and should be the first thing you check if you need help. We try to keep it up-to-date with as much information as possible on how to use Mishira.</p>

	<h3>Live chat</h3>
	<p>If you cannot find what you're looking for in the user manual then feel free to join our <a href="http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=mishira">live chat</a>. If you have a question just ask and if somebody is available they'll try and help you out. <b>Please stay in the channel for at least 5 or 10 minutes</b> after asking your question as it may take a while for somebody to respond.</p>
