<h1 class="center">We want your help to make Mishira awesome!</h1>

<p id="mission-statement">Our mission is to create a streamlined and polished user experience for recording and broadcasting video over the internet using entirely free and open source software.</p>

<p>
Want to help out on Mishira? We don't stop you! New contributors to the project are always welcome even if it's only a small bug fix or even if it's just helping spread the word of the project to others. You don't even need to ask; just do it!
</p>

<h3>Source code</h3>

<p>
The Mishira source code is <a href="https://www.github.com/mishira">hosted on GitHub</a>. As the Mishira project contains multiple Git repositories in order to build a usable binary from the source code you will need to clone each repository and follow the building instructions that can be found in the `BUILDING.md` file of each repository.
</p>

<h3>Live chat</h3>

<p>
The Mishira user community can regularly be found in the <a href="irc://irc.freenode.org/mishira">#mishira</a> IRC channel on the <a href="http://www.freenode.org/">Freenode</a> network. Developers usually also hang out in <a href="irc://irc.freenode.org/mishira-devel">#mishira-devel</a> from time to time. You can access the user channel via a web interface by clicking <a href="http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=mishira">here</a>.
</p>

<h3>Issue tracker</h3>

<p>
The <a href="https://github.com/mishira/mishira/issues">GitHub issue tracker</a> in the main Mishira repository is the preferred channel for bug reports, feature requests and submitting pull requests.
</p>

<h3>Bug reports</h3>

<p>
A bug is a <i>demonstrable problem</i> in the current version of the application. Bugs are a major cause of user frustration and should always be prioritised over adding new features. Good bug reports are extremely helpful so if you find a bug please let us know via our issue tracker!
</p>

<p>
Before submitting a bug report please first spend the time searching the issue tracker to see if it has already been reported by somebody else. If you find an existing report feel free to add additional information to it if you believe it would be helpful for developers.
</p>

<h3>Feature requests</h3>

<p>
Feature requests are always welcome but please take a moment to find out if your idea fits within the scope and goals of the project before submitting it to our issue tracker. Mishira is not meant to be a jack-of-all-trades video editor so having too many features can result in buggy unmaintained code that will cause more user frustrations than what it's worth. It is up to <i>you</i> to make a strong case to convince the project's developers of the merits of your requested feature. Please provide as much detail and context as possible.
</p>

<p>
If you are uncertain as to whether or not your feature request is within the scope of the project feel free to contact the developers via the IRC channel (Preferred) or E-mail.
</p>

<h3>Pull requests</h3>

<p>
Good pull requests containing patches, improvements and new features are a fantastic way to help the project. Before submitting a pull request please make sure that any source code follows the same coding style as what is already used in the repository and that the Git history does not contain unrelated commits.
</p>

<p>
<b>Before starting any significant work</b> please make sure that you contact the existing developers to ensure that your pull request is likely to be accepted and merged into the official repository. You don't want to spend a lot of time working on something that is unlikely to be accepted due to being outside the scope of the project or if its already been worked on by somebody else.
</p>

<p>
If working on a part of the project that contains unit tests please also write additional tests for your code before you submit the pull request. While unit tests can take time to write they are useful for ensuring that any written code continues to operating correctly into the future even after you stop contributing to the project. Many parts of Mishira have very strict performance requirements and even the smallest change elsewhere in the project could result in subtle performance bugs that are only visible to users with certain hardware configurations.
</p>
